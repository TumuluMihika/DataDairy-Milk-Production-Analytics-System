DataDairy-Milk-Production-Analytics-System 🥛📊
📌 Project Overview
DataDairy-Milk-Production-Analytics-System is a data analysis project designed to explore historical milk production data. The project performs various data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization tasks to derive insights about milk production trends over time.

📁 Dataset
Filename: Milk_production.csv

Description: Contains monthly milk production per cow (in pounds) from 2003 to 2013.

Columns:

Month: The date of the record.

Milk Production: Pounds of milk produced per cow.

🚀 Features
Data loading and preprocessing

Date conversion and indexing

Sorting and aggregating milk production data:

Maximum and minimum production

Ascending and descending sorting

Visual representation using multiple chart types

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib

📊 Visualizations Included
